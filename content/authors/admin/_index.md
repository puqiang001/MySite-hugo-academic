Hello! This is Qiang Pu. I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Geography](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/geography.html) at the [University at Buffalo, SUNY](https://www.buffalo.edu/). My research interests are broadly in the areas of GIScience and environmental health. Specifically, by leveraging advanced geospatial technologies, such as geostatistics/machine learning models, satellite remote sensing, GPS, and GIS, I study the spatiotemporal distributions and uncertainties of ambient PM2.5 exposures. I'm also interested in evaluating the healthcare accessibility in low and low-middle income countries using open geospatial data.

I received a M.S. in Cartography and GIS and a B.S. in Geomatics Engineering both from School of Geosciences and Info-physics at [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/). I am currently a member of [GEOEH Lab](https://ubwp.buffalo.edu/geoeh/home/) at UB.
