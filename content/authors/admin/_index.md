Hello! I'm Qiang Pu, a Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health](https://sph.emory.edu/departments/eh/index.html), at the [Emory University](https://sph.emory.edu/index.html). Currently, I'm working with the [Emory Environmental Remote Sensing Group](https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/remote-sensing-group/author/yliu74/). My research interests lie at the intersection of GIScience and environmental health, where I model the spatiotemporal distributions and uncertainties of ambient environmental exposures (e.g. air pollution and heat). I use advanced geospatial technologies, such as geostatistics/machine learning models, satellite remote sensing, GPS, and GIS, to provide insights into potential health impacts and support evidence-based policy and decision-making.

I received my Ph.D. in Geography from [University at Buffalo, SUNY](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/geography.html), an M.S. in Cartography and GIS and a B.S. in Geomatics Engineering from the School of Geosciences and Info-physics at [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/).
